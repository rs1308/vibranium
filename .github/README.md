# Vibranium

Vibranium is an Arch Linux configuration, which aims to provide beautiful-looking set of configs and themes, while being very customizable and very fast. It provides a set of overlay-based menus (rofi) where you can configure almost every aspect of your typical desktop usage: appearance of the WM & status bar, general behavior, like package management or how certain things work together.

## Installation

See [wiki page](https://github.com/shvedes/vibranium/wiki#installation)

## Currenet State

Vibranium is currently in beta testing. Some features may break or not work at all. Breaking changes may occur at any time. If you want to install Vibranium for testing purposes only, it is best to do so in a virtual machine. In this case, some functionality will be unavailable. You can still install Vibranium on real hardware, and that would be a better choice.

### Code Quality

The code is currently focused on functionality rather than structure. Refactoring and performance improvements will come once all core features are implemented. The project’s architecture wasn’t planned from the start, so rewriting from scratch wasn’t practical-hence the current state of the code.
